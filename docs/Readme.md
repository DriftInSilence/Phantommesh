# 📚 PhantomMesh Documentation Index

Welcome to the technical documentation space for **PhantomMesh**—an adaptive deception and schema-driven security framework focused on behavioral misdirection, forensic observability, and cryptographic trust tracking.

## 🔍 What Is PhantomMesh Really Trying to Solve?

PhantomMesh tackles a fundamental flaw in traditional security: the assumption that all threats are known and linear.

Instead of building bigger walls, PhantomMesh builds smarter illusions—designed to:
- Confuse and exhaust adversaries.
- Log their actions with forensic integrity.
- Adapt trust dynamically using behavior, entropy, and schema awareness.
- Create a world where attacking becomes riskier, louder, and—ultimately—self-defeating.

This isn’t just defense. It’s deterrence through digital judo.

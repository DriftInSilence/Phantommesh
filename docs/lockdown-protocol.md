# 🛑 Red Canary Lockdown Protocol

_The Red Canary Lockdown Protocol is the physical override mechanism of PhantomMesh. It exists to enforce critical edit boundaries within the trust logic layer—requiring explicit, physical operator presence to modify high-risk rules or behavioral thresholds._

It’s not symbolic. It’s hardware-backed defense.

---

## 🔍 Purpose

To enforce:
- Immutable defensive logic in runtime environments
- Manual verification for system-altering decisions
- A clear boundary between runtime AI and administrative override

---

## 🔐 Core Features

### Physical Override Key Requirement
- A physical interaction is mandatory to modify:
  - Trust decay curves
  - Deception trigger thresholds
  - Reroute rules for Phantom layers
- Supports:
  - Hardware keypads
  - Secure USB cryptographic tokens
  - Biometric-only console wake logic

### Immutable Config Layer
- Certain rule sets are written in hardware-fused ROM or OTP flash
- Cannot be changed via OS or admin-level access alone
- Requiring dual-person validation or pre-signed override capsules

### Air-Gapped Terminal Access
- All override operations must occur from an **offline terminal**
- No SSH, no remote exec—even via secure proxy
- Special console interface required for edits

## 🧩 Triggered Conditions

| Event                            | Lockdown Behavior                          |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Unauthorized trust rule patch    | Edit blocked and alert raised              |
| Override attempt via remote API  | System lockdown triggered + escalation     |
| PhantomSanity scoring tampered   | Protocol blocks daemon and burns session   |
| Missing override key at runtime  | Access denied to deception modification    |

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

| Scenario                             | Expected Result                            |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Dev attempts live entropy tweak      | Failure without key + alert in PhantomPulse |
| PhantomLedger logs deleted remotely  | Blocked if not signed + hash mismatch alert |
| Session tamper detected mid-deploy   | Lockdown triggers full containment cascade  |

## 🗝️ Why Red Canary?

- **Canaries are early warning systems.**
- In this context, the *Red Canary* is the line you do not cross.
- The protocol ensures no AI-driven system becomes its own god-mode editor.

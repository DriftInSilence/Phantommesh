# 🔐 PhantomLedger – Cryptographic Logging Core

_PhantomLedger is the immutable memory layer of PhantomMesh. It captures every relevant behavioral nuance and escalation point through tamper-evident structures designed for forensic fidelity and replay._

It is not merely a logger—it is a testimony engine.

## 🎯 Purpose

To ensure that:
- All trust decisions and behavior deviations are captured
- No adversary action can be erased or manipulated
- Every session path is auditable, reproducible, and verifiable

---

## 🔑 Key Features

### `Hash Chain Logging`
- Appends logs in a cryptographically verifiable chain
- Supports both linear (`sha256-next`) and Merkle-style schemes
- Can rotate hashes based on trust events or payload types

### `Multi-Mode Log Capture`
- Captures logs by semantic tier:
  - `session_metadata`
  - `payload_snapshot`
  - `trust_score_fluctuations`
  - `phantom_reroute_events`

### `Cold Storage Support`
- Encrypted storage vaults: local or cloud-based
- Log compression (zstd/gzip) with write rotation
- Air-gapped export compliance

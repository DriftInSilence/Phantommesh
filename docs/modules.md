# 📦 PhantomMesh Modules

> _“Precision lies not in perfection—but in preparation.”_

This document expands on the modular components of PhantomMesh. Each module is designed to operate independently or synergistically, adapting to threat posture, trust context, and system resilience thresholds.

---

## 🔁 HHP – Heartbeat Harmony Protocol  
**Function:** Detects trust drift using timing patterns, entropy correlation, and behavioral synchronization.  
**Role:** Establishes dynamic “trust cadence” between user agents and host nodes.  
**Tactic:** Breaks rhythm upon anomalies, signaling schema decay or session quarantine.

---

## 💽 Trust Buffer – Drift Buffer Layer  
**Function:** Ambiguates hostile session recognition via delayed resolution.  
**Role:** Prevents premature system response to suspected adversary input.  
**Tactic:** Holds suspicious sessions in a liminal state, feeding decoy schema as needed.

---

## ⌛ TDCS – Time-Decay Crypto Schema  
**Function:** Encrypts schema structures with lifespan-bound logic.  
**Role:** Ensures ephemeral trust chains—key pairs expire silently if not reinforced.  
**Tactic:** Defangs replay attacks and breach reuse by shortening utility windows.

---

## 🐦 Red Canary – Insider Privilege Monitor  
**Function:** Monitors schema manipulations from privileged actors.  
**Role:** Flags asymmetric behavior even in trusted execution zones.  
**Tactic:** Emits decoy schema or hardens containerized environments under duress.

---

## 🧬 FSP – Forensic Snapshot Protocol  
**Function:** Captures volatile state, I/O patterns, and actor intent on failure tier transition.  
**Role:** Equips system for self-diagnosis post-degradation.  
**Tactic:** Triggers conditional logging before full fallback, preserving adversary footprint.

---

## 🌫️ Echo Decay – Schema Entropy Drift Engine  
**Function:** Monitors entropy quality and symmetry.  
**Role:** Maintains randomness integrity of deployed schema logic.  
**Tactic:** Automatically regenerates schema segments approaching entropy decay thresholds.

---

## 🔐 LURD – Legitimate User Recovery Directive  
**Function:** Enables trusted users to recover under degraded schema states.  
**Role:** Builds resilience for false positives and system recovery.  
**Tactic:** Escalates recovery tier with user-bound encrypted logic handoff.

---

## 🐝 SSP – Schema Swarm Protocol  
**Function:** Distributes fragments of schema logic across memory pools.  
**Role:** Prevents full state visibility during memory scraping or live exploit attempts.  
**Tactic:** Enforces sharded logic delivery across phantom threads.

---

## ⌘ Meta-Layer Coordination  
Each module feeds a **Mesh Coordinator** layer—responsible for trust scoring, schema distribution timing, and fallback tier management. While modules are standalone, their strength lies in mesh reactivity.

---

> **Note:** These modules are conceptual in nature and are intended to provoke design thinking. Their names, functions, and tactics reflect speculative architecture and evolving threats.

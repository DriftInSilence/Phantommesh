# 📡 PhantomChannel – Deceptive Communication Layer

_PhantomChannel controls how sessions move, reroute, and communicate between reality and illusion. It manages fallback schemas, fake interfaces, and silent handoffs between tiers of trust within PhantomMesh._

It’s the voice that speaks when silence would raise suspicion.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To orchestrate:
- Seamless transitions between trust tiers
- Schema-switching for deception communication
- Session rerouting through "ghost paths"
- Trust-aware signaling between modules

PhantomChannel ensures the adversary remains unaware of their reclassification—until it’s far too late.

## 🧠 Functional Components

### `SchemaSync Engine`
- Dynamically adapts communication schemas mid-session
- Supports:
  - HTTP(S), RPC variants, gRPC, WebSocket mimics
  - Deceptive parameter obfuscation
- Uses entropy and history to determine when a shift occurs

### `Fallback Protocol Resolver`
- Monitors primary channel health
- Transparently swaps to:
  - Pre-defined safe schemas (e.g., `schema-x`)
  - PhantomTier echo servers
- Ensures continuity even during staged outages or triggered breakouts

### `Ghost Path Management`
- Creates low-fidelity mirrored routes
- Used to:
  - Lead attackers into burnable zones
  - Segment botnets without tipping them off
  - Distribute timing profiles to evade correlation

## 🧾 Example Schema Drift

| From         | To            | Reason                          |
|--------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| `API v2`     | `PhantomAPI`  | Detected entropy mismatch       |
| `WebSocket`  | `Ghost RPC-λ` | Suspicious timing cadence       |
| `GraphQL`    | `Schema-ShadowX` | Large query delta vs baseline |

---

## 🧰 Configuration (Planned)

Controlled via `phantomchannel.conf`:

- Default schema map per trust tier
- Ghost route lifespans
- Trigger thresholds
- Replay loopback compatibility

_Not yet exposed publicly. Implementation pending._

## 🧪 Illusion Simulation Tips

- Randomize fallback schema headers per node
- Mimic versioning quirks of prior deployments
- Align ghost routes with time-of-day traffic to avoid raising flags

## 🔌 Module Interactions

| Module                    | Role                                           |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `phantomsanity.md`        | Determines when schema shift is required       |
| `lockdown-protocol.md`    | Controls fallback trigger overrides            |
| `phantompulse.md`         | Flags signal integrity drops before fallback   |

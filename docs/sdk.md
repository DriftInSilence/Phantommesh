# 🧰 PhantomSDK – Simulation & Integration Toolkit

_PhantomSDK is the development harness for extending, integrating, and simulating PhantomMesh components. It enables red team simulations, trust engine prototyping, and safe experimentation with behavioral entropy without altering the core mesh._

It’s the testbed, the forge, and the mirror maze for code that wants to learn deception.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Allow developers to run PhantomMesh modules in isolation
- Inject simulated behavior sequences for entropy/timing analysis
- Prototype new config schemas before runtime deployment
- Enable protocol developers to explore channel/fallback behavior

---

## ⚙️ Features

### Modular Harness Loading
- Run any core module (`phantomsanity`, `phantomledger`, etc.) as a dry module
- Supports local `.yaml` overrides and mock pulse feeds

### Entropy Injection Framework
- Define scripted key inputs, navigation patterns, and timing anomalies
- Inject adversarial fingerprints to trigger reroute logic
- Useful for testing false positives and trigger thresholds

### Simulation Profiles
- Describe full session flows including:
  - Time of day
  - Device signature
  - Input cadence variation
  - Behavioral drift rate
- Profiles stored as `.simprofile.yaml`

### SDK Log Replay
- Feed PhantomLedger logs into replay engine
- Visualize trust decay, escalation, and trap deployments

## 🧰 Configuration

SDK reads from:

- `config/phantomsanity.yaml` – live scoring thresholds
- `sdk/profiles/*.sim.yaml` – simulation behavior outlines
- `sdk/logs/` – used by replay engine and visualizer

## 🔌 Integration Points

| Module              | Hook Type              |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| `phantomsanity`     | Entropy injection, trust override testing |
| `phantomledger`     | Log generation, replay validation |
| `phantomchannel`    | Schema switch testing, fallback mimicry |
| `phantompulse`      | Timing spoof simulation |

## 🧠 Use Cases

- 🔬 Trust engine tuning under lab-grade behavioral noise
- 🎭 Red team deception campaigns with reroute verification
- 🎯 Drift-resilient profiling for long-session identity validation
- 🔄 CI test suite for trust-score regressions

# PhantomMesh – Adaptive Defense Concept  
*Schema-based misdirection. Trust drift analytics. Containment by design.*

---

## 🔍 What is PhantomMesh?

PhantomMesh is a conceptual security framework for systems that adapt, mislead, and contain adversaries through:

- **Schema-driven defense logic**
- **Phantom decoy environments**
- **Entropy-aware trust scoring**
- **Tiered fallback resilience**

This isn’t a product. It’s a speculative blueprint meant to reframe how we think about deception, recovery, and adversarial control.

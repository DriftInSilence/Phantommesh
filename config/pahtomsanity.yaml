# ðŸš§ EXAMPLE CONFIG ONLY â€“ Not reflective of live deployment logic
# This file illustrates the trust scoring logic used by PhantomSanity.
# Modify thresholds and parameters carefully in live environments.

trust_engine:
  scoring_mode: "adaptive"        # options: static, adaptive, hybrid
  base_threshold: 0.70            # default trust level for known devices/users
  deception_trigger: 0.35         # sessions below this are rerouted into PhantomMesh
  sandbox_threshold: 0.50         # sessions below this go to sandbox first

entropy_tuning:
  entropy_window: 60s             # how long entropy is sampled per session
  low_entropy_floor: 0.25         # indicates possible script automation
  entropy_drift_tolerance: 0.08   # max allowed deviation before marking anomaly

logging:
  mode: "narrative"               # options: statistical, narrative, forensic
  sample_window: 90s
  audit_trails: true
  drift_snapshots: true

baseline_profiles:
  whitelist_devices:
    - device_id: "device-alpha9a1f"
      behavior_profile: "steady"
    - device_id: "device-gamma3bf4"
      behavior_profile: "mobile-variant"
  auto_baselining: false          # enables learning unknown session rhythms over time

load_adaptation:
  system_cpu_threshold: 75        # when crossed, switch to reduced logging
  fallback_logging_mode: "statistical"
  throttle_behavior_scanning: true

experimental_flags:
  curiosity_amplification: true   # boosts lures if entropy is near trigger zone
  response_lag_injection: false   # slows response to frustrate bot probes

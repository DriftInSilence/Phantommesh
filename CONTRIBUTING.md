# 🤝 Contributing to PhantomMesh

Thank you for your interest in shaping PhantomMesh. This is a conceptual framework with real architectural teeth—and we welcome anyone thoughtful enough to help sharpen its edge.

---

## 🧠 Ground Rules

- **This is a thoughtspace first.** All contributions, whether code, docs, or debate, must respect the vision and the integrity of the system.
- **Deception ≠ confusion.** Your contributions should improve clarity, not bury things in cleverness.
- **Neurodivergent-friendly.** All brains welcome. No gatekeeping. No performance theater.

---

## 🛠 Code & Docs Standards

- Use consistent formatting (Prettier / Black / ESLint / MarkdownLint depending on file type).
- One module or fix per pull request. Clear commit messages.
- Follow the folder structure. Docs in `/docs`, configs in `/config`, code in `/src`.

---

## 🔄 Pull Request Flow

1. Fork this repo.
2. Create a feature branch (`feat/phantompulse-hardening`).
3. Make your changes + add tests/sim examples if applicable.
4. Submit a PR with:
   - What you changed
   - Why it matters
   - Where it fits

All contributions are reviewed by the PhantomMesh maintainers (currently DriftInSilence and friends).

## 🧪 Experimental Modules

Want to propose something wild like:
- an illusion orchestration agent
- a deception graph encoder
- an attacker regression predictor?

Bring it. Flag your PR as `[experimental]` so we know it's cooking. Spec it clearly, and we’ll sandbox it in `/labs`.

---

## 💡 Final Note

This project is speculative—but it’s serious. Every great system starts as a sketch.  
Your ideas are welcome. Your perspectives are valued. And your fingerprints—if you choose—could shape how deception defense evolves in the future.
